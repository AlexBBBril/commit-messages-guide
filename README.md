## What is a "commit"?

In a simple and roughly way, a commit from is a kind of a _snapshot_ of your local files, written in your local repository.
Contrary to what some people think, [git doesn't store only the difference between the files, it stores a full version of all files](https://git-scm.com/book/eo/v1/Ekkomenci-Git-Basics#Snapshots,-Not-Differences).
For files that didn't change from a commit to another, git stores just a link to the previous identical file that is already stored.

The image bellow show how git stores data over time, in which each "Version" is a commmit:
